2008-10-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: hush warnings.

2008-09-25  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c: Typo in error message "droping" now "dropping".

2008-09-22  Juraj Skripsky  <js@hotfeet.ch>

	* mod_mono.conf.in: Add new file types (as registered in
	/etc/mono/2.0/web.config).

2008-07-14  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c: Always acquire a lock at the start of processing
	a request. The active requests counter function now assumes the
	lock is already aquired. Also added a accepting_requests flag
	to the dashboard so that xsp configurations can be paused. Now
	when restarting mod-mono-server from the control panel, the
	configuration is set to not accepting requests (503s returned)
	until after the restart. This fixed a problem that when requests
	came in during a restart, mod-mono-server would never successfully
	come back but it would keep getting forked. The flag can also
	be turned on and off through the control panel.

2008-07-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (write_string_to_buffer, send_initial_data): use
	32-bit integers explicitly.

2008-07-11  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h (PROTOCOL_VERSION): bumped to 9

	* src/mod_mono.c: added new structure, initial_data_info, used to
	optimize the send_initial_data function.
	(write_string_to_buffer): added new parameter, str_length, which
	optionally provides the string length.
	(get_table_send_size, write_table_to_buffer): serialized table
	contains the whole table size in addition to element count now.
	(send_initial_data): when calculating the initial data size use
	the initial_data_info structure to store the figures, so that we
	don't have to do it again later on in the code.
	Protocol version is followed by the total block size now, so that
	mod_mono_server can retrieve the initial data in one recv call
	instead of in a series of those.

	* configure.in: added support for compiling with profiling
	information (--enable-gprof)

2008-05-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: work correctly with IPv6 sockets, by detecting
	the socket family instead of hard-coding it to AF_INET.
	Do not get the default server's socket name until it is known
	which mode the server should work in (tcp or unix sockets).
	Fixes bug #392235
	Patches contributed by Alex Villacís Lasso
	<avillaci@ceibo.fiec.espol.edu.ec>, thanks!

2008-04-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: add several ifdefs for compilation with apache
	1.3. Fixes bug #374272

2008-01-28  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Version bump -> 1.9

2008-01-21  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c: Implemented configurable rate limiting
	  with MonoMaxActiveRequests and MonoMaxWaitingRequests.

2008-01-20  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c:
	  ensure_dashboard_initialized:
	  - Try to delete an existing lockfile before creating a mutex
	    (relevant if the lock type uses files).
	  - Don't always try to remove the shm file (as root). This
	    means we could never attach to an existing shm. The file
	    ought to always be created as the apache user anyway.
	    Instead, only delete after a failed attach.
	  - Don't always call apr_shm_baseaddr_get in every call to this.
	  - Code cleanup and fixes (a return should have been a goto).
	  mono_execute_request:
	  - Check that dashboard was actually created before accessing it.
	  start_xsp:
	  - Don't use the xsp->status flag in Apache 2+ since this is
	    handled by the new cross-process locking mechanism.
	  terminate_xsp2:
	  - No need to check if xsp->dashboard_shm was changed while
	    waiting for a lock: that's impossible. (It's not multi-threaded.)
	  - Don't call apr_shm_detach before apr_shm_destroy. That's not
	    the right use of the API.

2007-11-08  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Version bump -> 1.2.6

2007-11-07  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* configure.in: added a --with-apu-config option, which lets one
	select an apu-config path different to the auto-detected
	one. Fixes bug #324685

2007-10-16  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (xsp_data): revert the flush logic - use
	'no_flush' instead of 'do_flush' as it matches the managed side
	more closely. Fixes (again) bug #325441

	* src/mod_mono.h (cmdNames): reorder the names to match the enum.

2007-10-03  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: removed documentation of the recently added
	MonoFlushOnWrite directive. It is replaced by the new protocol
	command described below.

	* src/mod_mono.h: added the PROTOCOL_VERSION define (and bumped
	the protocol value to 8, as a new command has been added).
	Defined a new command, SET_CONFIGURATION, which is used to
	configure mod_mono/apache from within the Mono ASP.NET runtime
	(currently only HttpResponse.BufferOutput is sent)

	* src/mod_mono.c: implemented new command, SET_CONFIGURATION.
	Use PROTOCOL_VERSION macro when necessary instead of using the
	literal integer value.
	Removed the recently added MonoFlushOnWrite directive.

2007-10-02  Marek Habersack  <grendello@gmail.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: added more info for  the MonoFlushOnWrite
	directive.

2007-10-01  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: implemented support for flushing the Apache
	output buffers on every write, configurable via the
	MonoFlushOnWrite directive.

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: added documentation of the MonoFlushOnWrite
	directive.

2007-09-27  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: document the restart options as Apache 2.0+
	only.

	* src/mod_mono.h: move all apr includes to the APACHE2-only
	section.

	* src/mod_mono.c: disable dashboard (and restart) for Apache 1.3 -
	the support requires apr, which cannot be used in 1.3 modules (as
	far as I know). Module compiles fine with Apache 1.3 now

2007-09-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: added three wrapper functions to get the apache
	configured user id, group id and user name.
	(ensure_dashboard_initialized): attempt to remove the dashboard
	file (if dashboard hasn't been created yet) as root, not as the
	target user.

	* src/mod_mono.h: unixd.h is not found in APACHE 1.3

2007-09-16  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c (mono_execute_request): if it can't establish a
	connection after several attempts at forking, emit an error and
	don't continue on assuming the connection is there (causes ENOTCONN).

2007-08-22  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (terminate_xsp2): if apache is shutting down,
	destroy the mutex too, to avoid a leak.

2007-08-10  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (terminate_xsp2): take an extra argument telling
	whether to acquire the dashboard lock before attempting to destroy
	the dashboard.

	* configure.in: typo fixed

2007-08-08  Joshua Tauberer  <jit@occams.info>

	* src/mod_mono.c: some fixes for the cross-process
	locking and refactored process limits.
	- Added a flag in the dashboard to ensure only one child process
	issues an automated restart request to xsp.
	- Don't assume the mutex is actually ever created in case of problems.
	- Don't call apr_global_mutex_child_init if MOD_MONO_LOCKING_MECHANISM
	is set, since for me this causes all locks to block forever.
	- Improved some error messages and added one about command stream
	corruption.
	- When the auto-restart check cannot get a lock, don't return a
	HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE status code, since we've already successfully
	sent page output.
	- Don't reset the dashboard in start_xsp if no fork was necessary.
	- Included dashboard info in the control panel.
	- Refactored process limits in order to aid debugging on why it
	doesn't work at all.

2007-08-06  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* configure.in: added --enable-gcov option to enable gcov(1)
	compilation options.

	* src/mod_mono.c (get_apr_locking_mechanism): use the
	MOD_MONO_LOCKING_MECHANISM environment variable which lets the
	user choose the dashboard locking mechanism on the runtime. It
	must be set through the envvar since the module must know the
	value before launching the backends, and that happens before the
	config is fully parsed and merged.

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: documented new environment variable
	MOD_MONO_LOCKING_MECHANISM.

2007-07-30  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h (HAVE_UNIXD): define HAVE_UNIXD if we're running
	on a platform that uses it.

	* src/mod_mono.c (mono_execute_request): initialize the global
	mutex in the child process at the first request after we
	initialize mod_mono. The call needs to be made in the child
	process, so it can't stay in the initialization section of
	ensure_dashboard_initialized.
	(ensure_dashboard_initialized): if necessary, set the global mutex
	permissions.
	(ensure_dashboard_initialized): check if unixd_config has correct
	data before attempting to use it.
	(fork_mod_mono_server): as above.

2007-07-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: added documentation for the new directives

	* src/mod_mono.c: implemented backend auto-restart feature, along
	with corresponding configuration directives, cross-process (or
	cross-thread) locking. The housekeeping data is kept in a
	per-backend shared memory segment (a dashboard) and is protected
	with a mutex. The backends can be auto-restarted based on the
	number of requests served, or their uptime.
	Removed some debug statements.

2007-07-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (mono_execute_request): added support for
	restarting backends which disappeared.
	(mono_cmds): defined two new configuration directives:
	MonoXSPStartAttempts and MonoXSPStartWaitTime, used by code
	introduced above.
	
	* man/mod_mono.8.in: added documentation for the two new
	directives.

2007-07-18  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: if APR has uid/gid support and
	we're not compiling for WIN32, start the backends from the module
	post config handler, it avoids launching of many backends on
	startup.

2007-07-14  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (do_command): added error logging
	(write_data): as above
	(read_data): as above

	* src/mod_mono.h (STATCODE_AND_SERVER): new macro to add support
	for non-zero status codes (the status code is ignored for Apache <
	2.0).

2007-06-20  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (send_initial_data): added support for
	ServerAlias directive. Patch from Juraj Skripsky
	<juraj@hotfeet.ch>, thanks! Closes bug #81878.

2007-04-19  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Version bump -> 1.2.4

2007-04-03  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: add checking for headers as configured by
	apu-config.  It's possible to have libapr headers in a different
	location than libapr-util headers. (happens on suse 10.1)

2007-03-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (do_command.GET_CLIENT_BLOCK): If we get a -1
	from ap_get_client_block, send that value but not any further
	data.   There is now a guard in xsp for this condition.

2007-03-28  Marek Habersack  <grendello@gmail.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c (do_command): abort when either xsp sends us size
	of -1 in the GET_CLIENT_BLOCK command or when ap_get_client_block
	returns -1 as the result of client breaking the connection. This
	action prevents an exception later on in xsp.

2006-11-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c:
	* ChangeLog: revert r66281 and r66836. It should make mod_mono work
	again for most of the people, while it will break for certain virtual
	host configurations.

2006-11-02  Wade Berrier  <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version -> 1.2

2006-10-26  Marek Habersack  <grendello@gmail.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: describe the new MonoUnixUmask directive.
	* src/mod_mono.c: add code to handle the new configurable umask
	directive.

2006-10-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: avoid using too much memory for long responses.
	* src/mod_mono.h: defines for 1.3 to work with apr_pool. Fixes bug
	#79701. Thanks to Cyrille Colin.

2006-08-31 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: Fix problem in Solaris 9 due to alignment. Patch by
	Jonathan Zimmerman. Closes bug #78232.

2006-08-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in:
	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: From now on, we run the mod-mono-server or
	mod-mono-server2 script instead of running mono directly. This is
	needed after the latest changes in the runtime that will make
	ShadowCopyFiles possible.

2006-08-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in: Add documentation about MOD_MONO_CCV variable 
	used to control the validation of X.509 client certificates.

2006-08-02 Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Make sure CPPFLAGS get propogated

2006-08-02 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: make it work with the latest and greates apache 2.2.3
	and simplified.

2006-07-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: when using autoapplications, pass all the options that
	don't have an explicit alias to XXGLOBAL, which is the internal name
	used for the mod-mono-server instance that will create new applications
	on demand. Using XXGLOBAL as an identifier is forbidden now.

2006-07-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: allow setting MonoDebug when using automatic
	applications. Before this fix, no mod-mono-server would be started.
	Fixes bug #78672.

2006-04-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: reuse the memory allocated when mod-mono-server reads
	the request body. Patch by Dean Brettle.

2006-03-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: the number of arguments for apr_socket_create
	depends on the apr version used when compiling. Fixes bug #77933.

2006-03-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h: fix compilation for systems that do not have stdint.h.
	Patch by "CK Ng".

2006-03-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: more hackery for 1.3 and apr-config. Fixes bug #77928.
	Patch by jedynamic@bellsouth.net.

2006-03-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: add apxs -q CFLAGS. Fixes bug #77764.

2006-02-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: append --includes from apr-config to CFLAGS.

2006-01-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: actually write the result of IS_CONNECTED. Patch by
	Cyrille Colin.

2005-12-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in:
	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: now apache 2.2 is supported.

2005-12-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: patch by Dean Brettle that fixes chunked encoding
	support.

2005-11-29 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* man/mod_mono.8.in:
	* INSTALL: add documentation about the control panel. Patch by Matthew
	Law.

2005-11-12 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: make auto-hosting work in apache 1.3.

2005-11-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: fix problems in 1.1.10 regarding user-configured applications.
	We were finding the global server instead of the default one.

2005-11-09  Robert Jordan  <robertj@gmx.net>

	* src/mod_mono.*: fixed compatibility issue with Apache 1.3.

2005-11-02 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* mod_mono.conf.in: added ASP.NET extensions to the configuration file.
	* src/mod_mono.c: added MonoAutoApplication directive and support for
	automatically registering new ASP.NET applications as they are
	discovered.

2005-10-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.1.9.99.
	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: server variables are now written with the rest of
	the initial data sent to mod-mono-server. Variables starting with HTTP_
	are not sent, as those will be created by System.Web from the headers.

2005-10-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: send all the server variables in one single write.
	Before we did 2 writes per variable. Incremented version to 5. You'll
	need to sync with xsp.
	* src/mod_mono.h: add table defines for apache 1.3.

2005-10-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.[ch]:
	(get_default_socket_name): handle the NULL alias case setting it to
	"default".
	Style fixes and replaced sprintf with apr_psprintf.

2005-09-23 Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	* src/mod_mono.c:
	
	  The default alias for xsp's within vhosts is the name of the
	  vhost server, so that vhosts with default aliases don't all
	  use the same Unix socket file name.  A new is_default field
	  tracks whether an XSP is the server default, rather than using
	  the "default" alias.
	  
	  Aliases are never NULL except when passed to search_for_alias,
	  start_xsp, and terminate_xsp2.
	  
	  The control panel is amended so that individual XSPs
	  can be restarted.

2005-09-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: if we read 0 bytes, stop the loop in apr_socket_recv
	used in apache 1.3. Patch by Mathias Herberts.

2005-09-01 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: one single read for all the headers.
	Update xsp too.

2005-08-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: new SEND_FILE command that uses apache's ap_send_fd
	when sending a file. No more sucking when mod_mono serves static files.

2005-07-26 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h: updated to new default path for mod-mono-server.exe.
	WARNING: this might break if you don't install an up-to-date xsp!!!

2005-07-25 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* INSTALL:
	* man/mod_mono.8.in: the path for the xsp tests has changed.

2005-07-18 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* mod_mono.conf.in: use <IfModule>

2005-06-02 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/Makefile.am: no need to set PREFIX for apxs.

2005-05-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: support for IS_CONNECTED and increased version
	number.

2005-05-03  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.0.9

2005-04-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: when checking for http_protocol.h, include httpd.h too.
	Patch from Bill Middleton.

2005-04-21 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: added control panel from Joshua Tauberer.
	* src/mod_mono.h: uri_component 1.3 -> apr_uri_t in 2.0

2005-04-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h: forgot to add a define for apache 1.3 with the
	equivalent apr_table_addn.

2005-04-20 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: don't overwrite headers already set. Fixes bug #74507.

2005-04-19 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: add CGI and other variables to the request.

2005-03-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* INSTALL:
	* man/mod_mono.8.in: documented MonoSetEnv.

2005-03-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: added MonoSetEnv directive. From a patch by Joel
	Reed to 1.0.6.

2005-03-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: try to connect to mod-mono-server before forking.
	Patch by Rob Lyon.

2005-03-05 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.0.6.99.
	* src/mod_mono.c: patch from Rob Lyon that fixes unix socket deletion
	when the default name is used.

2005-02-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: some small changes that make this work on amd64.
	Thanks to Mike Morano.

2005-02-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: make the new 'several mod-mono-server' schema work
	when directives are inside <virtualhost>.

2005-02-16 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: prevent execution of 'init' twice (parent and child)
	under apache 1.3.
	* src/mod_mono.h: added extern declaration for 2 apache 1.3 variables.

2005-02-15 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.h: removed <apr_env.h>.

2005-02-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: SERVER_PORT_SECURE returns true if we're https. Part
	of the fix for bug #71680.

2005-02-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* INSTALL:
	* man/mod_mono.8.in: updated.

2005-02-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: no ranlib.

	* src/mod_mono.c: fixed a few minor problems found under apache 1.3.
	Don't pass the default mono config. directory to servers others than
	the default one. Fixed the default socket file name for non-default
	servers.

	* src/mod_mono.h: MonoSetServerAlias takes 1 argument even on
	apache 1.3.

	* README: updated...

2005-02-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: fixed autoscan warning and use 'if test'.
	* src/mod_mono.[ch]: added support for starting more than one
	mod-mono-server. All the existing directives can take now 2 parameters,
	the first being an alias for a mod-mono-server instance. Added
	MonoSetServerAlias to be used inside Location/Directory to choose which
	mod-mono-server instance will be used. The alias 'default' is assumed
	if the alias argument is omitted.

2005-02-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: removed MonoDebug stuff and unused
	apr_wait_for_io_or_timeout when compiling for apache 1.3.

	unused by now and the second one a set of applications to be appended
	to the existing ones.

	* src/mod_mono.h: #defined MAKE_CMD_ITERATE2.

2005-02-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: added --enable-debug to compile mod_mono with verbose
	logging.
	* src/mod_mono.c: comment on DEBUG and remove the unix socket file upon
	termination of mod-mono-server, just in case the finalizers are not
	called.

	Thanks to Rob Lyon.

2005-02-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in:
	* src/mod_mono.h: define our own variable when building for a big-endian
	architecture instead of using WORDS_BIGENDIAN, since some packages might
	have that defined on little-endian machines !?. Thanks to Winfried
	Harbecke for pointing this out.

2005-02-04 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.0.5.99
	* src/mod_mono.c: start mod-mono-server in the child_init step. This

	* configure.in: added more tests for functions/headers. New option to
	set the default MonoApplicationsConfigDir.

	* src/mod_mono.c: don't use sleep and don't fork mod-mono-server if
	we're terminating and mod-mono-server wasn't started.

	* src/mod_mono.h: this should be ok to compile on windows now.

	Thanks to Angel Marín.

2004-10-27 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: patch by alois.belaska@monetplus.cz that fixes
	mod_mono wrong behavior for big pages. Closes bugs #67938 and #68554.

2004-09-24 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: double fork is back. When the configuration pool is
	cleaned up, we tell mod-mono-server to terminate instead of sending a
	SIGTERM, thus allowing unloading the applications and Application_End
	event being triggered.

	warnings.

2004-09-09 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	rpms out of this. Building the old module is no longer an option.

2004-08-12  Geoff Norton <gnorton@customerdna.com>

	* INSTALL:
	* man/mod_mono.8.in:
	* src/mod_mono.c:  Use RLIMIT_DATA as opposed to RLIMIT_AS; because
	RLIMIT_AS isn't defined on all platforms.  Update documentation to
	reflect this change.

2004-07-29 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.0.1
	* src/mod_mono.c: attempt to address sigsegv seem on Fedora when all
	defaults are used. Write to the error log if the user does not have
	permission on .wapi directory.

2004-07-28 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: s/apr-0/apr/

	* INSTALL:

	other minor updates.

2004-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	post_config hook.

2004-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	like #ifdef inside macro parameters.

2004-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: check for setrlimit.
	* src/mod_mono.c: added MonoMaxMemory and MonoMaxCPUTime directives. If
	set and setlimit is available, mod_mono will set those limits when
	spwning mod-mono-server.

2004-07-14 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/mod_mono.c:
	* src/mod_mono.h: moved conditional cruft to a header file. Fixed note
	on default value for MonoRunXSP. NOT_FOUND is defined in apache 1.3, so
	changed it to MYNOT_FOUND. Removed a few simple functions. In short,
	shuffling code.

2004-07-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: ap_conn_flush does a *final* flush on the connection,
	and that conflicts with mod_ssl handling of End-Of-Connection buckets,
	so, connection_flush is a noop now.
	See bug #60117 for details.

2004-07-13 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: added NOT_FOUND command and prevent invalid commands
	from crashing mod_mono.

2004-07-11 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in:
	* src/mod_mono.c: seems like apr_socket_connect is post 0.9.2 version
	of libapr.

2004-07-10 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: added listen port and listen address used when
	communicating with mod-mono-server over a TCP socket. Implemented

	--debug option when forking mono.

2004-07-08 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: removed more commands and send their data upon
	connection.

2004-07-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: removed the mutex stuff that prevented multiple forks
	no first request. It doesn't work on RH9 :-? (worked on debian sid with
	apache2 and 1.3).

2004-07-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* src/mod_mono.c: removed unused commands, unified setting status code
	and message into one single command. Now apache handles closing the
	socket used to connect to mod-mono-server and waiting, terminating or
	killing the forked process when the configuration is reloaded or apache
	is shut down. When we get several request, don't fork more than once.

2004-07-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>
